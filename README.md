### âž¢ Tasked as category manager to improve profitability of perishable items (Fruits, Butter, Chicken, Veggies, Bread) under limited storage capacity (100 unit area).
### âž¢ Required to decide optimal purchase order for each item by analyzing sales price, cost price, storage requirement, and loss per lot, to maximize total profit within storage constraints.
### âž¢ Collected and analyzed historical data on cost, sales, storage, and wastage. Designed a profit-per-unit-area model to calculate efficiency of each item and balance profit maximization against perishable losses.
### âž¢ Optimize storage allocation strategy that maximized profit within 100 units of storage capacity and demonstrated ability to apply data-driven decision-making and mathematical optimization to real-world supply chain problems.
